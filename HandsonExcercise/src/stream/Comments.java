	Given a list of strings, filter out the strings that contain the letter 'a', convert the remaining strings to uppercase, and join them into a single comma-separated string.

	Question 32: Mapping and Averaging

	Suppose you have a list of integers. Use the Stream API to square each integer, then calculate the average of the squared values.

	Question 33: Filtering and Distinct

	Given a list of integers, filter out the even numbers, and then find the distinct odd numbers. Collect the results into a new list.

	Question 34: Partitioning and Counting

	Given a list of strings, partition them into two groups: one group containing strings of length less than 5 and another group containing strings of length 5 or more. Count the number of strings in each group.

	Question 35: Mapping and Reducing

	Imagine you have a list of doubles representing product prices. Use the Stream API to increase each price by 10%, and then calculate the total discounted amount
